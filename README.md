# Computer Vision @ NTU CSIE, Fall 2021

## HW1
- Part1. Write a program to do the following requirement.
    - (a) upside-down lena.bmp
    - (b) right-side-left lena.bmp
    - (c) diagonally flip lena.bmp
- Part2. Write a program or use software to do the following requirement.
    - (d) rotate lena.bmp 45 degrees clockwise
    - (e) shrink lena.bmp in half
    - (f) binarize lena.bmp at 128 to get a binary image

## HW2
- Write a program to generate:
    - (a) a binary image (threshold at 128)
    - (b) a histogram
    - (c) connected components(regions with + at centroid, bounding box)

## HW3
- Write a program to generate images and histograms:
    - (a) original image and its histogram
    - (b) image with intensity divided by 3 and its histogram
    - (c) image after applying histogram equalization to (b) and its histogram

## HW4
- Write programs which do binary morphology on a binary image:
    - (a) Dilation
    - (b) Erosion
    - (c) Opening
    - (d) Closing
    - (e) Hit-and-miss transform

## HW5
- Write programs which do gray-scale morphology on a gray-scale image(lena.bmp):
    - (a) Dilation
    - (b) Erosion
    - (c) Opening
    - (d) Closing

## HW6
- Write a program which counts the Yokoi connectivity number on a downsampled image(lena.bmp).

## HW7
- Write a program which does thinning on a downsampled image (lena.bmp).

## HW8
- Write a program which does:
    - (a) Generate noisy images with gaussian noise(amplitude of 10 and 30)
    - (b) Generate noisy images with salt-and-pepper noise( probability 0.1 and 0.05)
    - (c) Use the 3x3, 5x5 box filter on images generated by (a)(b)
    - (d) Use 3x3, 5x5 median filter on images generated by (a)(b)
    - (e) Use both opening-then-closing and closing-then opening filter (using the octogonal 3-5-5-5-3 kernel, value = 0) on images generated by (a)(b)
    - You must calculate the signal-to-ratio (SNR) for each instance(4 noisy images and 24 processed images)

## HW9
- You are to implement following edge detectors with thresholds:
    - (a) Robert's Operator: 12
    - (b) Prewitt's Edge Detector: 24
    - (c) Sobel's Edge Detector: 38
    - (d) Frei and Chen's Gradient Operator: 30
    - (e) Kirsch's Compass Operator: 135
    - (f) Robinson's Compass Operator: 43
    - (g) Nevatia-Babu 5x5 Operator: 12500
