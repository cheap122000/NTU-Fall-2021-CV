# Computer Vision @ NTU CSIE, Fall 2021

## HW1
- Part1. Write a program to do the following requirement.
    - (a) upside-down lena.bmp
    - (b) right-side-left lena.bmp
    - (c) diagonally flip lena.bmp
- Part2. Write a program or use software to do the following requirement.
    - (d) rotate lena.bmp 45 degrees clockwise
    - (e) shrink lena.bmp in half
    - (f) binarize lena.bmp at 128 to get a binary image

## HW2
- Write a program to generate:
    - (a) a binary image (threshold at 128)
    - (b) a histogram
    - (c) connected components(regions with + at centroid, bounding box)

## HW3
- Write a program to generate images and histograms:
    - (a) original image and its histogram
    - (b) image with intensity divided by 3 and its histogram
    - (c) image after applying histogram equalization to (b) and its histogram

## HW4
- Write programs which do binary morphology on a binary image:
    - (a) Dilation
    - (b) Erosion
    - (c) Opening
    - (d) Closing
    - (e) Hit-and-miss transform

## HW5
- Write programs which do gray-scale morphology on a gray-scale image(lena.bmp):
    - (a) Dilation
    - (b) Erosion
    - (c) Opening
    - (d) Closing
